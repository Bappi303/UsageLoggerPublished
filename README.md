# Usage Logger

Usage logger is an app that records aspects of how a person uses their phone. Primarily developed to assist with psychological research and behavioural science more generally. The app can be customised to perform a number of different functions: record what a person has previously used their phone for (up to five days), get context for how the app works &/or log how people use their device in the future. 

See how the app works in our [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VET3PkaNayo&feature=youtu.be)

A report on the app has been submitted for publication and is awaiting peer review. 

Download the app from the [Google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=geyerk.sensorlab.uractivity&hl=en_GB).

## Customisation

This is also explained in the customisation website (see above for link). The prospective logging can record a lot of different types of data: 

* When the screen is on/off
* When apps are used
* When notifications are sent & which apps send the apps
* When apps are un/installed
* etc. 

Retrospective logging provides by default:

* When the screen is on/off
* When apps are employed
* etc. 

The data to understand the context includes: 

* What apps are installed
* What permissions the apps request
* What permissions requests are accepted/rejected by users

## FAQ

1. Why do I need a decrypting website

You don’t need the decrypting website. You can open the encrypted pdf files yourself but they will be in a pdf format which is difficult to convert into a csv or easy to use format. For that reason we have supplied a website that automatically converts the pdf files in csv files. 

2. From your other app you’ve talked about doze mode, is this still a problem?

In our other [app](https://github.com/kris-geyer/pegLog) we’ve talked about doze mode. This is when the android device halts all background operations because the participant has not used their phone for a lengthy duration. This isn’t an issue for usage logger because we are only interested in monitoring the usage when the phone is in use. So it seems really unlikely that we lose data due to doze mode.
