    "Usage logger is an Android app that records or extracts data about how a person uses their smartphonephone. Primarily developed to assist with psychological research and behavioural science more generally, the app can be customised to perform a number of different functions. This includes an ability to extract historical data about previous (retrospective) usage form the previous 5 days. \n",
